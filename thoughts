Sequentially store prefix => list of followers

Random prefix......? how?
Random follower.....? how?

Followers are a set (can't have more than 1)

LinkedSet for followers

??? for the prefix - need to support indexing

array of linkedSets? -> of what size since it can't suffer from collisions?

solution:
scan doc once first, count the number of words
set hash array size to:    noOfWords - prefix - 1
scan it again to add to the hash table?
